Comparing PPO and Q-Learning for Minesweeper: A Reinforcement Learning Approach
Eduardo Pareja Lema, Karan Vohra, Puneet Khanna

The Minesweeper environment was activated by importing PyGame and downloading a Minesweeper ZIP file from GitHub. Once the Minesweeper environment was installed and the following imports were implemented in the respective .py files for the simulation and agents: OS, Sys, NumPy, Integer Enum, PyTorch (Neural Network, Functional Neural Network, and Optimizer), Collections for Dequeue, MatPlotLib for PyPlot, Random, Dictionary, CSV, JSON, and Pickle, the .py files will compile and can then be run for the Q-learning and PPO algorithms to achieve the outcomes referenced in the report.
